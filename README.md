I always wanted to create a learning and education focused website to share my learnings in the hope that someone will find them useful. In my experience there is too much material on the same topics and not enough on the intermediete to advanced ones. Being a software engineer you are legally obligated to code your website. I did so using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). With all the growing and interesting framework I find that small and focused applications are perfect for experimenting with them. Libraries are tools and great depending on the problem. Not too long ago I attempted to use React to build my portfolio and there was a lot of friction. In my opinion React is the wrong tool for my use case. I am focused on simple links and text for my website which a static site generator handles quickly.
