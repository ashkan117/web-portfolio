      <description>DP is an Art Link to heading Snapshot is clear, global is not Link to heading An issue I ran into with developing an intuition with dp is that in some cases the immediete solution is obvious yet I had a nagging sense of how could it be right long term. To explain my issue I&amp;rsquo;ll go through a leetcode problem. https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/description/
The case specifially which led to this is one where we can see a large cost being unattractive short term but my intuition was telling me couldn&amp;rsquo;t it be possible that in the long run this is good?</description>

      <description>Pre Requisites Link to heading This post won&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on the following topics since there is already many great ones:
Choose unchoose pattern Leetcode Combinations Problem https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/description Backtracking Context Link to heading This pattern is often just given as a part of a template for similar problems/ https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/solutions/429526/general-backtracking-questions-solutions-in-python-for-reference/ https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/solutions/27006/a-template-to-those-combination-problems/
My goal is to better give intuition behind it by comparing it to an equivalent but different code
My Initial Solution Link to heading I was working on Leetcode Combinations problem and realized that this is an choose unchoose pattern like problem but my implementation seemed a little funny in comparison.</description>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading Welcome to my page. How you got here I have no clue but I hope it can be of service to you in some way. My goal for this page is to discuss some concepts that I think are of value. Short and sweet posts that expand or introduce you to topics that I stumbled on. After some time I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to avoid some websites like medium since they end up beating some topics to death.</description>
