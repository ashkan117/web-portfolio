      <description>Introduction Link to heading Today we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at Insert Interval. The reason why I think this is a useful problem to learn is because it helps you approach these problems in such a way where the code is more intuitive. Essentially the reasoning behind this problem and others like it is that it is not the high level solving that&amp;rsquo;s difficult but rather the code. The way of viewing these problems that simplify the thinking is by viewing it as a finding an index.</description>

      <description>:ROAM_ALIASES: &amp;ldquo;Leetcode 542&amp;rdquo;
Trouble Link to heading Even if you traverse the node wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you need to traverse the node for every node. For each node we&amp;rsquo;d need to determine the distance by traversing it? Multiple traversals are costly
A Dynamic Programming solution comes into play. Ask your neighbor what is the distance to 0 from you. Pick the neighbor with min distance

      <description>Introduction Link to heading After some time working on Leetcode you start to realize trends in the problem. One category that I have recognized is one where the &amp;ldquo;elegant&amp;rdquo; solution uses simple logic to narrow out work.
Brute Force Link to heading Create a sliding window with the size of minSize. One of the rules that we need to follow is that the number of unique characters &amp;lt; maxLetters. This is easier than you might think.</description>

      <title>The Nature of BST nodes (LCA of BST Case Study)</title>

      <description>Characteristics of the problem Link to heading You can&amp;rsquo;t start out with the root (lowest common ancestor) This is really a traversal problem Each node has a range of values that it could contain which is from [min(leftSubtree), max(rightSubtree)]. Understanding this range means we know the possible children of a node through its value. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore the last two towards the end of the blog since these are not as intuitive.</description>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading I found a few resources that I think did a decent job at explaining bits and pieces but not the full thing. This is also a tool for me to think things through as I go through the proof.
Leetcode solution with useful insights
Math stackexchange with useful insights
Neetcode&amp;rsquo;s solution, useful insights on proof
Unrelated but cool modulus related history
Note for clarity Link to heading First node of the tail means -T First node of the cycle means 0</description>

      <title>Leetcode 91: Decode Ways (Bounding your recursive calls)</title>
      <link>http://ashkanfaghihi.dev/posts/decode-ways/</link>

      <guid>http://ashkanfaghihi.dev/posts/decode-ways/</guid>
      <description>Why I like this problem Link to heading https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/
A lot of the canonical recursive problems you start out with have really simple code. Things that come to mind are https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/, https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/ and https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/. This is because the recursive calls are really simple, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really require you to understand how the recursive calls unwind. Decode ways does this will for a few reasons.
The subproblems are not trivial to &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; You can&amp;rsquo;t blindly make recursive calls Note: Most solutions end up doing a bottom up approach which is better, I just want to discuess the top down approach since that is usually my first way to tackle these problems.</description>

      <title>Quarrel With Dynamic Programming</title>

      <description>DP is an Art Link to heading Snapshot is clear, global is not Link to heading An issue I ran into with developing an intuition with dp is that in some cases the immediete solution is obvious yet I had a nagging sense of how could it be right long term. To explain my issue I&amp;rsquo;ll go through a leetcode problem. https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/description/
The case specifially which led to this is one where we can see a large cost being unattractive short term but my intuition was telling me couldn&amp;rsquo;t it be possible that in the long run this is good?</description>

      <title>Choose Unchoose Pattern Case Study</title>

      <description>Pre Requisites Link to heading This post won&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on the following topics since there is already many great ones:
Choose unchoose pattern Leetcode Combinations Problem https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/description Backtracking Context Link to heading This pattern is often just given as a part of a template for similar problems/ https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/solutions/429526/general-backtracking-questions-solutions-in-python-for-reference/ https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/solutions/27006/a-template-to-those-combination-problems/
My goal is to better give intuition behind it by comparing it to an equivalent but different code
My Initial Solution Link to heading I was working on Leetcode Combinations problem and realized that this is an choose unchoose pattern like problem but my implementation seemed a little funny in comparison.</description>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading Welcome to my page. How you got here I have no clue but I hope it can be of service to you in some way. My goal for this page is to discuss some concepts that I think are of value. Short and sweet posts that expand or introduce you to topics that I stumbled on. After some time I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to avoid some websites like medium since they end up beating some topics to death.</description>
