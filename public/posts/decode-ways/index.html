A lot of the canonical recursive problems you start out with have really simple code. Things that come to mind are <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/">https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/</a>,  <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/">https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/">https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/</a>. This is because the recursive calls are really simple, it doesn&rsquo;t really require you to understand how the recursive calls unwind. Decode ways does this will for a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>The subproblems are not trivial to &ldquo;build&rdquo;</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t blindly make recursive calls</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Most solutions end up doing a bottom up approach which is better, I just want to discuess the top down approach since that is usually my first way to tackle these problems.
This also reminds me of <strong>Generate Parentheses</strong> since we have some bounds on when we can make recursive calls.</p>

<p>There were a few things that you must recognize before you can tackle the solution. One of them isn&rsquo;t too difficult to notice. The easy case with recursion is usually just take one off the current input. If we have &ldquo;226&rdquo; we can see that the solution does depend on &ldquo;22&rdquo;. &ldquo;22&rdquo; therefore depends on &ldquo;2&rdquo;. The case that&rsquo;s a little harder to notice is that you always want to consider two character substrings as well. Given &ldquo;226&rdquo;, the solution also depends on what the results of &ldquo;26&rdquo; subproblem are. Likewise when we&rsquo;re looking at &ldquo;22&rdquo; we need to treat this as a two digit number as well. This leads to the 3 paths for input &ldquo;226&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Input: s = &ldquo;226&rdquo;
Output: 3
Explanation: &ldquo;226&rdquo; could be decoded as &ldquo;BZ&rdquo; (2 26), &ldquo;VF&rdquo; (22 6), or &ldquo;BBF&rdquo; (2 2 6).</p>
<p>The cases aren&rsquo;t exactly the most complicated but I did run into issues trying to code this breakdown of subproblems with off by one errors.</p>

<p>In the simple recursive problems I mentioned above you can simply return based off rec(n - 1) + rec(n - 2). You can always break the problem down in simple ways like this. In Decode Ways this is not the case. You need to handle the fact that the &ldquo;Decode&rdquo; we&rsquo;re doing is only valid from &ldquo;1&rdquo; - &ldquo;26&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s look at the case &ldquo;336&rdquo; to explore this a little more. We can take &ldquo;6&rdquo; and we&rsquo;re left with &ldquo;33&rdquo;. This is not a valid way to decode things though since it&rsquo;s not a valid numerical representation for a character. Therefore we &ldquo;prune&rdquo; this path, we don&rsquo;t want to continue down recursively since it&rsquo;s not fruitful.</p>
<p>Another case is &ldquo;220&rdquo;. You can&rsquo;t always assume the single character way works as well. You can&rsquo;t break things down into take &ldquo;0&rdquo; then solve the subproblem of &ldquo;22&rdquo; since &ldquo;0&rdquo; is not valid. This means we need another check for &ldquo;0&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This leads us to our two important checks,</p>
<ol>
<li>You can only take a single digit character if it is not &ldquo;0&rdquo;</li>
<li>You can only take a two digit character if the value it represents is [10, 26] inclusive.</li>
</ol>
