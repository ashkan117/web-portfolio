    title: "About Me"
    content: |-
      I started my development journey in mobile development. I had an Android phone at the time so with no prior application experience just went at it. It was hard. Very hard. Android specifically was a pretty hard first introduction to application development. But I kept going. Slowly I thought it made more sense to create cross platform applications in order to allow anyone to download a published applcation. Eventually I made the decision to learn about web development since it allows anyone to easily see your projects without needing to download anything. Learning how to code is not difficult but it takes time. At first it's just a lot of jargon but that's normal. Even while developming mobile applications I didn't really understand databases. When I started web development I didn't really get the difference between front end and backend. Focus around things you want to build and things get a little easier from there.
