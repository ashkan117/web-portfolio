## Introduction

After almost a year with Elixir I wanted to take some time to document some of the things I learned and mistakes I made. There are a few things that trip you up so I wanted to write down what that was for me so I have a place to come back and hopefully help people learn from these. All this specific post will be is a table of contents to more detailed examples.

## Keyword Lists

[Why Keyword Lists]({{< ref "why-keyword-list.md" >}}) explores what Keyword Lists are. This data structure at first glance seems unnecessary so it's hard to build an intuition at first. This post covers what's different about them since it was something I haven't seen (that I know of) in other languages.
