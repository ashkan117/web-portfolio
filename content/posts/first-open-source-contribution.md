## Small Wins

In celebration of a new version of ExDocs, I wanted to write about my first open source contribution.

## What it takes

Open source contributions are important for many reasons. A selfish one is weirdly based off status.

- The change was extremely small (8 total lines)
- It was a change I wanted and makes a noticeable difference for me

This is a win but I want to preface it with this is not a meaningful change in the grand scheme of things.

Some of the challenges I noticed with Lexical LSP

- The complexity of the project is a lot harder
- It's not quite a precision change
- The domain knowledge is harder
