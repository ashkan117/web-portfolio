## Introduction

Welcome to my page. How you got here I have no clue but I hope it can be of service to you in some way. My goal for this page is to discuss some concepts that I think are of value. Short and sweet posts that expand or introduce you to topics that I stumbled on. After some time I've learned to avoid some websites like medium since they end up beating some topics to death. I don't want this to be what I do. There are already amazing resources and any topic so I will only make posts that I haven't seen or posts on a new angle that I don't believe was talked about yet with the exception of programming interview questions. 

I started this blog after being laid off from my first job during the wave of tech layoffs in 2022. So it will likely be a place where I journal my process through the programming interview. Any leetcode related blogs won't be of insane value but I do my best to only put down importnant nuggets or as a collection of things I have found useful.

These are ultimately my ramblings. I am not sure how many, if any, eyes will see this so I don't want to spend too much effort on it yet. However, if actual eyes are viewing this and they have thoughts, questions, or concerns; please reach out.
